Continuous happiness is strongly connected to
 finding peace and balance in different parts
 of life. This includes feeling good inside yourself,
 having happy relationships with family and friends,
 getting along well in your community, and respecting
 the natural world around you. When everything is in harmony
 like this, it makes it easier to stay happy and content.
